### User 0:

**entrance →** 

basic colors for begining

no much interface 

**main menu →** 

go back issue

**main game →** 

basic color/ animation for game

moving is simple enough

fair difficulty

glad the monster is moving

need an ending 

need to implement the game features

### User 1:

**entrance →** 

clear

“minimalistic”

**main menu →** 

need guidance message,

colour are basic, 

better make the interface in a row

**main game →** 

don’t understand what the game is for, 

recognise the monster but not clear what its for, 

found difficult to solve the maze with the monsters existing 

begins and ends needs to be signed

expecting multiple levels

attacked by a ghost → start over from the beginning again

control with arrow keys are fine

### User 2:

**entrance →** 

think should be able to click anywhere to start

**menu →** 

going back issue

**main game →** 

need to guide users how to move

what the characters/monsters for
